# JSON Parse Error Fix

## Problem Analysis

From the execution screenshot, we can see:
- Servo is running successfully ✅
- Output is being saved to temp files ✅  
- The parsing finds a result: "Found single property result" ✅
- But JSON parsing fails with "expected value at line 1 column 1" ❌

The output shows `+ JSON.stringify({` which suggests the JSON is incomplete or malformed.

## Root Causes

1. **Incomplete JSON**: The JavaScript might be getting interrupted before completing the JSON output
2. **Extra Characters**: There might be extra characters before/after the JSON
3. **Timing Issues**: Servo might be closing too quickly before the console.log completes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced JSON Cleaning
- Added `.trim()` to remove extra whitespace
- Better error messages showing the raw content

### 2. Improved Error Handling  
- Show first 200 characters of failed JSON for debugging
- More descriptive error messages

### 3. JavaScript Timing Fix
Need to increase the timeout in the JavaScript to ensure console.log completes:

```javascript
// Give Servo more time to log then exit
setTimeout(function() { window.close(); }, 500);  // Increased from 100ms
```

## Testing on Linux

After these fixes, run on Linux:
1. `./enable_servo.sh` 
2. `cargo run --example real_servo_demo`
3. Check the debug files in `/tmp/servo_*` if issues persist

The enhanced error messages will show exactly what JSON content is being parsed, making it easier to diagnose any remaining issues.
