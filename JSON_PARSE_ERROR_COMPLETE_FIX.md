# JSON Parse Error - Complete Fix

## Issue Summary
Your code was running on Linux but failing with:
**"JSON parse error: expected value at line 1 column 1"**

## Root Cause
The JavaScript in Servo was not completing its `console.log()` output before the browser closed, resulting in incomplete JSON.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced JSON Parsing (`servo_style_engine_real.rs`)
- Added `.trim()` to clean JSON before parsing
- Enhanced error messages showing first 200 characters of failed JSON
- Better debugging output

### 2. Increased JavaScript Timeout  
- Changed `setTimeout(window.close, 100)` â†’ `setTimeout(window.close, 500)`
- Gives Servo more time to complete console output
- Applied to both single property and all styles queries

### 3. Better Error Reporting
- Shows raw JSON content when parsing fails
- More descriptive error messages for debugging

## Files Modified
- âœ… `src/servo_style_engine_real.rs` - Enhanced JSON parsing and timeouts
- âœ… `JSON_PARSE_ERROR_FIX.md` - Documentation
- âœ… All compilation issues previously fixed

## Ready for Linux Testing

Transfer these files to Linux and run:

```bash
# 1. Configure Servo path
./enable_servo.sh

# 2. Test the fix
cargo run --example real_servo_demo

# 3. If still issues, check debug files
ls -la /tmp/servo_*
cat /tmp/servo_parsed_*.txt
```

## Expected Output
Instead of JSON parse errors, you should now see:
```
âœ… Found single property result
ðŸŽ¯ .highlight -> color: rgb(255, 0, 0)
ðŸ“„ Parsed result saved to: /tmp/servo_parsed_*.txt
```

## Debug Information
If issues persist, the enhanced error messages will show:
- Exact JSON content being parsed
- First 200 characters of failed JSON
- Raw content for analysis

The fix addresses the timing issue that was causing incomplete JSON output from Servo's console.log statements.
